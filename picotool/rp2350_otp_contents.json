The entries are either _VALUEs where the 16 bit value is used as is, or _STRDEFs which acts as a pointers to a string value. The value stored in a _STRDEF is two separate bytes: The low seven bits of the first (LSB) byte indicates the number of characters in the string, and the top bit of the first (LSB) byte if set to indicate that each character in the string is two bytes (Unicode) versus one byte if unset. The second (MSB) byte represents the location of the string data, and is encoded as the number of rows from this USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR; i.e. the row of the start of the string is USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR value + msb_byte. In each case, the corresponding valid bit enables replacing the default value for the corresponding item provided by the boot rom. Note that Unicode _STRDEFs are only supported for USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT_STRDEF, USB_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER_STRDEF and USB_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER_STRDEF. Unicode values will be ignored if specified for other fields, and non-unicode values for these three items will be converted to Unicode characters by setting the upper 8 bits to zero. Note that if the USB_WHITE_LABEL structure or the corresponding strings are not readable by BOOTSEL mode based on OTP permissions, or if alignment requirements are not met, then the corresponding default values are used. The index values indicate where each field is located (row USB_WHITE_LABEL_ADDR value + index): 0x0000 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_VID_VALUE 0x0001 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_PID_VALUE 0x0002 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_BCD_DEVICE_VALUE 0x0003 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_LANG_ID_VALUE 0x0004 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_MANUFACTURER_STRDEF 0x0005 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_PRODUCT_STRDEF 0x0006 -> INDEX_USB_DEVICE_SERIAL_NUMBER_STRDEF 0x0007 -> INDEX_USB_CONFIG_ATTRIBUTES_MAX_POWER_VALUES 0x0008 -> INDEX_VOLUME_LABEL_STRDEF 0x0009 -> INDEX_SCSI_INQUIRY_VENDOR_STRDEF 0x000a -> INDEX_SCSI_INQUIRY_PRODUCT_STRDEF 0x000b -> INDEX_SCSI_INQUIRY_VERSION_STRDEF 0x000c -> INDEX_INDEX_HTM_REDIRECT_URL_STRDEF 0x000d -> INDEX_INDEX_HTM_REDIRECT_NAME_STRDEF 0x000e -> INDEX_INFO_UF2_TXT_MODEL_STRDEF 0x000f -> INDEX_INFO_UF2_TXT_BOARD_ID_STRDEF",
